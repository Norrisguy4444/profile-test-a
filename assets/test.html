As a result, she has never been able to experience satisfaction, fulfillment, or happiness, and has not been able to experience emotions in the same capacity as other people.

The local police were unable to identify any suspects until an investigative journalist convinced them that one of the school's female students was the culprit. An arrest was made, and the schoolgirl went to court to face trial for her alleged crimes.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the time of the trial, Akademi High was a household name due to its international prestige. The nature of the trial - a schoolgirl accused of murdering multiple classmates to keep them out of a boy's love life - drew widespread media attention. As a result, the case was the most publicized criminal trial in Japanese history.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the end of the trial, the schoolgirl was found innocent. The police force who performed the arrest were widely criticized for taking the journalist's claims seriously. The journalist and the local police force were the laughingstock of the country for weeks.<\/p>\n\n<p>This event caused long-lasting changes in the policies of the Buraza Police Bureau. In order to avoid becoming the subject of national scrutiny ever again, they are now extremely reluctant to perform arrests without hard evidence, and dismiss individual eyewitness testimony unless it is backed up by at least 4 other individuals.<\/p>\n\n<p>When performing an investigation, the Buraza Police Bureau is heavily reliant on recent technology invented by Saikou Corp. This new technology allows the police to perform a full forensic investigation of a crime scene within minutes, as opposed to hours or days. For example, this technology can identify all traces of DNA on a murder weapon, allowing the police to identify a murderer almost instantaneously. Within a time span of 6 hours, the police can perform absolutely every type of forensic test possible, with plenty of time left over to question all witnesses present; as a result, if the police can't solve the crime within 6 hours, it's deemed to be unsolvable, and the case is closed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rumors of bribes between Akademi High's headmaster and the superintendent of the Buraza Police Bureau are firmly denied.<\/p>","illustrator":"Guillermo Varela Iglesias","illustratorUrl":"http:\/\/kjech.deviantart.com\/","groups":["Others"],"images":[{"url":"\/img\/characters\/police-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/police.png","name":""}]},{"name":"Info-chan","role":"Information Broker","status":"Ally","personality":"Unscrupulous","appearance":"Week 0","weakness":"?????","description":"<p>\"Info-chan\" is the nickname given to an information broker who specializes in collecting and selling dark secrets.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nobody knows her real name.

At some point, his daughter decided that she valued something else above her inheritance, and she left Japan to pursue a dream.<\/p>\n\n<p>This was absolutely devastating for Saisho, who had spent a significant amount of his life and fortune training his daughter to inherit his empire. He was forced to rely on his son to inherit the company, even though he had not given his son the same sort of training as his daughter. He advised his son to have multiple children so that if the firstborn doesn't want to inherit Saikou Corp, the other child would take up the responsibility. And so, Saisho's son had two children: a daughter named \"Megami\" and a son named \"Kencho.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Kencho is fully aware that he was conceived with the sole purpose of being a \"backup\" in case his sister ever dies or abandons her obligations towards her family. This fact was never hidden from him. As a result, his self-identity is based entirely on his relationship to Megami, and his sense of self-worth is derived by comparing himself to her.

However, his sister can outperform him in absolutely every way, which has caused him to develop an extreme inferiority complex.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kencho's father is aware that his son's rivalry towards his daughter is a potential problem, and so Kencho has been forbidden from attempting to interfere with Megami's life in any way.

He is quick to rush to the aid of anyone that is being harassed by other students, making it clear that \"If you pick a fight with them, you're picking a fight with me, too!\"<\/p>","illustrator":"Guillermo Varela Iglesias","illustratorUrl":"http:\/\/kjech.deviantart.com\/","groups":["Club Leaders"],"images":[{"url":"\/img\/characters\/martial-leader-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/martial-leader.png","name":""}]},{"name":"Miyuji Shan","role":"President of the Light Music Club","status":"Club Leader","personality":"Energetic","appearance":"Week 1","weakness":"?????","description":"<p>Last year, Miyuji was one of the quietest students at school. A shy bookworm, she usually kept to herself and avoided most social situations. She joined the Light Music Club purely to avoid the negative stigma that is associated with being clubless, and rarely participated in club activities or spoke to her clubmembers. The Light Music Club was a perfect match for her, since it was widely known for being the most relaxed and easygoing club in the whole school.<\/p>\n\n<p>One day, towards the end of the last semester, Miyuji arrived at school with a completely new personality and totally different sense of fashion. She was full of energy and self-confidence - the complete opposite of her previous self. She convinced the president of the Light Music Club to give her ownership of the club, and immediately changed its focus from soft mood music to a blend of punk rock and pop. Everyone who had been acquainted with her was completely shocked by her sudden, unexplained metamorphosis.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the same time that she unveiled her new persona, she also began to demonstrate exceptional skill with the electric guitar. She quickly attracted the attention of other musically-talented students, and it didn't take long for them to form a band - the Strawberry Thieves. They regularly thrill other students with performances in the Music Clubroom, and are quickly developing a fanbase among both students and faculty alike. The Strawberry Thieves are widely expected to have an extremely successful musical career once they graduate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyone with the slightest knowledge of musical instruments could instantly tell that Miyuji's newfound skills could not have possibly been formed overnight. She must have been practicing for years to develop such skill; but how had she kept it a secret, and for what purpose? What drove her to completely change everything about herself, from her fashion sense to her personality? Miyuji herself refuses to answer any questions about her \"metamorphosis\", replying in riddles whenever she is asked about the subject.<\/p>","illustrator":"Guillermo Varela Iglesias","illustratorUrl":"http:\/\/kjech.deviantart.com\/","groups":["Club Leaders"],"images":[{"url":"\/img\/characters\/music-leader-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/music-leader.png","name":""}]},{"name":"Fureddo Jonzu","role":"President of the Photography Club","status":"Club Leader","personality":"Natural-Born Leader","appearance":"Week 1","weakness":"?????","description":"<p>In previous years, the Photography Club was a serious club about the art of picture-taking, but the club is presently composed of a carefree group of students who actually have very little interest in photography, and are really just using the clubroom as their private hangout spot. The leader of this club is Fureddo, a young man who is known for his charisma and leadership skills - although he rarely uses his natural-born gifts for any meaningful purpose, and usually just spends his time goofing around with his laid-back friends.<\/p>\n\n<p>As their time at high school draws to a close, the members of the Photography Club are slowly beginning to regret the carefree way they have been spending their after-school hours. They want to look back on their high school years with pride; they don't want to feel like they accomplished nothing noteworthy during their youth. They are slowly becoming restless as they begin to yearn for a greater purpose; a challenge to overcome, an adversary to face, a mystery to solve.<\/p>\n\n<p>For now, the Photography Club is just a carefree group of friends...but they would quickly leap at any opportunity to make something of themselves. If any kind of mystery were to present itself, the Photography Club would immediately investigate the situation - and Fureddo, with his natural talent for leadership, would spearhead the effort to unravel any unsolved mystery, or identify the culprit of any unsolved crime.

Despite his genius, he is not a well-liked figure at Akademi High; he is prone to extremely bizarre behavior and frequently expresses thoughts that frighten and concern the people around him.<\/p>\n\n<p>He will openly speak of his aspirations for \"world domination\" to anyone that is willing to listen, although he refuses to divulge the specifics of his master plan. It is common knowledge that he has a deep obsession with Saikou Corporation, the most powerful business conglomerate in Japan. He has openly stated that he fully intends to become the CEO of Saikou Corp as soon as possible - but he never divulges how he intends to do so. Additionally, he also seems to be obsessed with the concept of constructing a giant robot.<\/p>\n\n<p>He could have easily gotten into a top university, but instead chose to enroll in Akademi High School, stating that it is \"the first step\" towards his ultimate ambitions. Many students have observed him studying the school's Student Council President, Megami Saikou, in a way that borders on stalking. His behavior can only be tolerated by other individuals who are almost as eccentric as he is, and so his club has come to be populated almost entirely by Akademi High's most unusual students.<\/p>","illustrator":"Guillermo Varela Iglesias","illustratorUrl":"http:\/\/kjech.deviantart.com\/","groups":["Club Leaders"],"images":[{"url":"\/img\/characters\/science-leader-full.png","thumb":"\/img\/characters\/science-leader.png","name":""}]},{"name":"Nemesis","role":"???","status":"???","personality":"???","appearance":"Mission Mode","weakness":"Being attacked from behind","description":"<p>\"Mission Mode\" takes place in a separate timeline from the main game.
